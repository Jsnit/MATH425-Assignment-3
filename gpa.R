# (a) Prepare a box plot for the ACT scores ùëãùëñ. Are there any noteworthy 
#     features in this plot?
# The boxplot shows Q1 (28-35), Interquartile Q2 from (22-28), Q1 (14-22), and 
# mean = 25

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# (b) Plot the residual ei against the fitted values(Y-Hat i), What departures 
#     from simple linear regression model can be studied from this plot? 
#     What are your findings?
# From the fitted vs residuals plot we can check:
# -Linearity of the data (If there is a non-linear pattern in this plot, it
#  suggests the relationship between X and Y isn't linear)
# -Variance of the data (If the spread in the data increases or decreases with 
#  the fitted values [Y-hat], The there is non-constant variance)
# -Outliers of the data appear as points far away from the rest of the residuals
# From this plot, I found that the relation between X & Y is linear, 
# the variance of the data is relatively constant through, and the
# data has a few outliers.
